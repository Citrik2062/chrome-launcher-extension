# chrome-launcher-extension
This is the sample code for an extension that lets you open custom links from a chrome extension.

HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

1. First, create a directory (folder), you can call it whatever you want (I will refer to it as "main directory")

2. Move the manifest.json, popup.html, and popup.js files into the main directory

3. In your main directory, add an image of your logo, the image should be 19 x 19 px, call it "icon.png"

4. In your main directory, add another image of your logo, it should be 128 x 128 px, call it "icon_128.png

5. Then, create another directory inside the main directory, call it "images"

6. In the images directory, add one last image of your logo, this one should be 140 x 140 px, call it whatever you want

7. In the manifest.json file, fill in the blanks to fit the name and description of your launcher

8. In the popup.html file, under "YOUR LOGO FILE NAME", change the name of the image to the one that you saved in the images directory

9. In the popup.html file, under "WEBSITE INFORMATION", change the href links to lead to your websites (it already says "YOUR _______ LINK HERE", bur you can choose any link you want

10. Then, change the <i class="fa fa-____"></i> under each website to any icon that fits your website (there are already pre-set icons for some websites) (You can find more icons at https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/ )

11. (optional) If you are familiar with JavaScript, you can edit the popup.js file to enhance you extension

HOW TO DOWNLOAD YOUR EXTENSION

1. Go to chrome://extensions/

2. In the top right corner enable "Developer mode"

3. In the top left corner click on "Load unpacked"

4. Select the main directory that you created and click "open"

5. Your newly created chrome extension should appear next to the search bar of google chrome, click on it, and you should be able to click on the images to access your websites!

HOW TO PUBLISH YOUR EXTENSION TO THE CHROME WEB STORE (costs $5.00 to make an account)

1. Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole

2. If you haven't already, agree to the terms and click on "Create an account" (it is a $5.00 one time fee, which I think is definetly worth it)

3. Enter your credit card information (it's not a scam, I promise)

4. You should now see the developer dashboard

5. Go back to your main directory and zip all the items into an archive

6. In the developer dashboard, scroll down to "ITEMS" and click "NEW ITEM"

7. Click on "BROWSE FILES" and select the zip file that you created

8. Enter information about your extension in the tabs on the left side

9. Click on "PUBLISH ITEM" at the top

10. Congratulations! Your extension is now in the publishing process. Chrome will moderate your extension, this can take a few weeks, so come back later and you should see that your extension has been published and on the Chrome Web Store!
